# Capactive Soil Moisture Sensor with LoRa

This sensor is a capacitive soil moisture sensor with a completely 3D printable housing, which can send its data over LoRaWAN into the IoT.

## Short Description

Are you interested in a soil moisture and temperature sensor that is suitable for plant pots? If so, you might want to check out my project: the “All in One Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor w/ LoRa”. This project combines capacitive sensing, LoRaWAN, and 3D printing technologies to create a simple, compact, and efficient sensor. It has a single PCB that serves as both the sensing element and the electronic circuit. A Heltec CubeCell module provides low-power LoRaWAN connectivity to an IoT network. The sensor also measures the actual soil temperature and calibrates the moisture readings for different soil types. A layer of epoxy protects the sensor from various environmental conditions and a rotary device helps to apply it evenly. The sensor is easy to install and use, as it only requires to be inserted into the soil. It also has a good battery life, lasting for several months without replacement.
